ğŸ”¢ Question: Check Armstrong Number

ğŸ“„ Description:
An **Armstrong number** is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1Â³ + 5Â³ + 3Â³ = 153.

ğŸ“˜ Example:
Input: n = 153  
Output: True  
Explanation: 1Â³ + 5Â³ + 3Â³ = 153, so it is an Armstrong number.

class Solution:
