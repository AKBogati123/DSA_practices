## 1.  MINDSET & FOUNDATION

### 1.1 The Success Equation

```
SUCCESS = (Effort + Strategy + Consistency) ^ Discipline

Without Discipline, everything else = 0
```

### 1.2 Identity Shift

| ❌ OLD Thinking | ✅ NEW Thinking |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "I'm just doing an online course" | "I'm an IIT Madras student" |
| "I'll study when I feel like it" | "I study every day, no matter what" |
| "This is hard for me" | "I can learn anything with effort" |
| "I hope I pass" | "I'm aiming for Grade S (90%+)" |
| "I'll figure it out later" | "I plan and execute systematically" |

### 1.3 Daily Affirmations (Read Every Morning)

```
1. "Today I will become better than yesterday"
2. "I am an IIT Madras student - I study like one"
3. "Difficulty is the path to mastery"
4. "I control my actions, my actions control my results"
5. "My family's investment in me will not go waste"
6. "4 years of focused work = 40 years of success"
7. "I am building my future, one day at a time"
```

### 1.4 The Truth About This Degree

| Concern | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "It's just online" | ❌ Wrong! Certificate says "IIT Madras" - same as campus |
| Will employers accept?  | ✅ Yes - IIT Madras brand is extremely powerful |
| Is it easier than campus? | ❌ No - same rigorous curriculum, same standards |
| Recognition | ✅ UGC approved, AICTE recognized |

## 2. THE GOLDEN RULES

### 2.1 The 10 Non-Negotiable Rules

```
RULE 1: 📚 STUDY EVERY SINGLE DAY
        No exceptions.  Even 2 hours on worst days. 
        Missing one day = Starting from scratch

RULE 2: 🎯 PRACTICE > WATCHING
        For every 1 hour of video, do 2 hours of practice
        Watching videos is NOT studying

RULE 3: ✍️ WRITE, DON'T JUST READ
        Writing activates deeper memory
        Notes, problems, formulas - write everything

RULE 4: 🔄 REVISE REPEATEDLY
        New learning = 100% forgotten in 7 days without revision
        Revise:  Same day → Next day → Week end → Month end

RULE 5: 😴 SLEEP 7-8 HOURS
        Brain consolidates learning during sleep
        Less sleep = Wasted study time

RULE 6: 📱 NO PHONE DURING STUDY
        Keep phone in another room
        Social media is the #1 productivity killer

RULE 7: 🎯 START ASSIGNMENTS EARLY
        Begin assignments on day content is released
        Never wait till deadline day

RULE 8: ✅ ATTEND BOTH QUIZZES
        More attempts = Better chances
        Quiz scores contribute to final grade

RULE 9: 💪 STRUGGLE BEFORE SOLUTIONS
        Try problems for 15-20 mins before looking at answers
        Struggling is how learning happens

RULE 10: 📊 TRACK EVERYTHING
         What gets measured gets improved
         Track scores, time, problems solved
```

#### 4.2.2 The 5 Questions Framework

For EVERY statistical concept, answer: 

```
1️⃣ WHAT is it?
   → Definition in simple words
   → Example: "Binomial distribution counts successes in n trials"

2️⃣ WHEN do I use it?
   → Identify the real-world situation
   → Example: "Use Binomial when there are fixed n trials,
               each with same probability p of success"

3️⃣ WHAT is the formula?
   → Write the formula clearly
   → Know what each symbol means
   → Example: P(X=k) = C(n,k) × pᵏ × (1-p)ⁿ⁻ᵏ

4️⃣ HOW do I calculate? 
   → Step-by-step calculation process
   → Practice with actual numbers

5️⃣ HOW do I interpret? 
   → What does the answer MEAN?
   → Connect back to real-world
```

#### 4.2.3 Distribution Master Table (MEMORIZE!)

##### Discrete Distributions

| Distribution | When to Use | Mean | Variance |
|--------------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Bernoulli** | Single yes/no trial | p | p(1-p) |
| **Binomial** | n trials, count success | np | np(1-p) |
| **Poisson** | Rare events, rate λ | λ | λ |
| **Geometric** | Trials until 1st success | 1/p | (1-p)/p² |
| **Neg. Binomial** | Trials until r successes | r/p | r(1-p)/p² |

##### Continuous Distributions

| Distribution | When to Use | Mean | Variance |
|--------------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Uniform** | Equal prob in [a,b] | (a+b)/2 | (b-a)²/12 |
| **Exponential** | Time between events | 1/λ | 1/λ² |
| **Normal** | Natural phenomena | μ | σ² |
| **Standard Normal** | Z-scores | 0 | 1 |
| **Chi-Square** | Sum of squared Z's | df | 2df |
| **t-distribution** | Small sample means | 0 | df/(df-2) |

#### 4.2.4 Hypothesis Testing 7-Step Framework

```
STEP 1: STATE THE HYPOTHESES
────────────────────────────
H₀ (Null): The "no effect" or "no difference" claim
H₁ (Alternative): What you're trying to prove

Types: 
• Two-tailed: H₁:  μ ≠ μ₀
• Right-tailed: H₁: μ > μ₀
• Left-tailed: H₁:  μ < μ₀

STEP 2: SET SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL (α)
──────────────────────────────────
Common values: α = 0.05 (5%) or α = 0.01 (1%)

STEP 3: IDENTIFY THE TEST
─────────────────────────
| Situation                    | Test to Use              |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Mean, σ known, large n       | Z-test                   |
| Mean, σ unknown, small n     | t-test                   |
| Proportion                   | Z-test for proportions   |
| Variance                     | Chi-square test          |
| Two means (independent)      | Two-sample t-test        |
| Two means (paired)           | Paired t-test            |
| Two variances                | F-test                   |

STEP 4: CALCULATE TEST STATISTIC
────────────────────────────────
Z = (x̄ - μ₀) / (σ/√n)  OR  t = (x̄ - μ₀) / (s/√n)

STEP 5: FIND CRITICAL VALUE OR P-VALUE
──────────────────────────────────────
• Critical value:  From Z-table or t-table
• P-value:  Probability of getting result as extreme

STEP 6: MAKE DECISION
─────────────────────
Method 1: |Test stat| > Critical value → Reject H₀
Method 2: P-value < α → Reject H₀

STEP 7: STATE CONCLUSION
────────────────────────
"At α = 0.05, there is [sufficient/insufficient] evidence to
 conclude that [H₁ in words]"
```
